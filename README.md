# Server-side for PerelView test-project
I created a server, running on Node.JS to retrieve a time in Israel timezone, and to check, if contact center is closed or not, and, if it is closed - hide "Click to call button".

Server returns whether contact center is closed or not on https://perelview.herokuapp.com/isclosed
### Contact center works hours:
Sunday-Thursday 8:00-17:00
Friday          8:00-12:00

### Server uses:
Node.JS
Express
moment.js
Server is deployed on heroku
